    <notes>
* FIXED: percentageColor2RGB() was dropping first character of each number
  instead of the percent sign at the end.
* FIXED: mixColors() and percentageColor2RGB() weren't rounding the values
  correctly. 50% of 255 is 127.5 and should round to 128 instead of 127.
* FIXED: setColors(). If the second parameter was omitted it would take on a
  random-ish value. I changed the implementation so that colors are only set
  when they're provided.
* FIXED: _makeWebSafe() was rounding values incorrectly. Significantly
  simplified the implementation in the process.
* Removed the private, unused Image_Color::$websafe member.
* Marked Image_Color::$color1 and $color2 as public. It made no sense that they
  were private considering that if you called changeLightness() the only way to
  find the result was using $color1 and $color2.
* Deprecated the _returnColor() function. All it was doing was converting RGB
  arrays to hex strings. The more aptly named rgb2hex() was calling
  _returnColor() which made no sense. _returnColor() now calls rgb2hex() and
  will probably disappear after the next release.
* Made major improvements to the comments and documentation and corrected
  several violations of the PEAR coding standards.
